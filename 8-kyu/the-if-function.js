  Who likes keywords? Nobody likes keywords, so why use them?

  You know what keyword I use too much? if! We should make a function called _if, with its arguments as a logical test and two functions/lambdas where the first function is executed if the boolean is true, and the second if it's false, like an if/else statement, so that we don't have to mess around with those nasty keywords! Even so, It should support truthy/falsy types just like the keyword.

  Example:
  _if(true, function(){console.log("True")}, function(){console.log("false")})
  // Logs 'True' to the console.
*/

function _if(bool, func1, func2) {
  bool ? func1() : func2();
}
